Part 5:
First i used the "man mkdir" command in coursera labs but it kept showin " No manual entry for mkdir".
So i used the github codespaces to do this question. I ran the " man mkdir " command on github codespace.

-p optionis a useful option as it allows us to create parent directories automatically if they do not
already exist .

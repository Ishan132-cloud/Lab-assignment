Part8:
 I moved the plan_copy.txt file into the archive directory using the "mv" command. Then using "cd" changed
 the directory to archive, then used ls to check if the file has been successfully tranferred.
 I then went back using "cd .." and checked if the file had been moved from the first directory to the
 subdirectory.

Part6:
The "mv" command is used for both moving and renaming files or directories. I used the mv command for changing
 the directory names. I was in the directory that was being renamed, so I went back using cd .. and then used the "ls"
 command to check if the name had been changed. The name was changed successfully. Then I used 
"cd" with the directory name to go back inside the directory.
